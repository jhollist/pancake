# pancake
Years of practice == damn fine pancakes

This recipe was originally inspired by a Cooks Illustrated recipe...  It has been slightly refined over the years

# Dry:
2 cups All Purpose Flour
1 - 2 Tbs sugar
2 tsp baking powder
1/2 - 3/4 tsp baking soda
1/2 tsp salt

# Wet
2 cups real Buttermilk (we use [Kates](http://kateshomemadebutter.com/))
4 - 6 Tbs unsalted butter, melted
2 eggs

Mix wet, mix dry, mix together but don't over mix.  We aren't making bread!

Cook up!  I use a cast iron griddle, dry.  Never sticks!

And please, please, please, only real Maple syrup!

## Variations:
Lots of varitation on this general theme.  I'll try to add them in later.
