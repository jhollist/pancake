Years of practice == damn fine pancakes

This recipe was originally inspired by a Cooks Illustrated recipe...  It has been slightly refined over the years

# Dry:
2 cups All Purpose Flour (we use King Arthur's Unbleached AP)
1 - 2 Tbs sugar
2 tsp baking powder
1/2 - 3/4 tsp baking soda
1/2 tsp salt

# Wet
2 cups real Buttermilk (we use [Kate's](http://kateshomemadebutter.com/))
4 - 6 Tbs unsalted butter, melted
2 eggs

Mix wet, mix dry, mix together but don't over mix.  We aren't making bread!

Cook up!  I use a cast iron griddle, dry.  Never sticks!

Makes 12-14 3-4 inch diameter pancakes.

And please, please, please, only real Maple syrup!

## Variations:
Lots of variations on this general theme.  I'll try to add them in later.

1. Use 1 cup All Purpose Flour and 1 cup White Whole Wheat, instead of 2 Cups of All Purpose (this is what I usually do)
2. If no buttermilk, I'll mix ~1 cup milk with ~1 cup whole milk plain yogurt.  Try to get it about as thick as buttermilk.
3. Fruit, thrown on top of cooking pancakes (use)
